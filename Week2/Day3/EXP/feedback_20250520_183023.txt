suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods could be made more consistent.  Currently, `__str__` adds an 's' to the currency, while `__repr__` does not.  Choose one consistent style.
- Exercise 1:  Add more comprehensive error handling.  For example, what happens if the `amount` in the `Currency` class isn't a number?
- Exercise 3: The initial `random_string` is initialized with a space.  This is unnecessary and makes the code slightly less efficient.
- Exercise 5: The output of the time difference could be formatted more clearly for better readability (e.g., showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds separately).
- Exercise 7: The `add_users` function has a bug. The `user_list.append(user)` is outside the loop.  This appends only the last generated user. It should be inside the loop.
- In general, add docstrings to functions to improve readability and explain their purpose.
