suggestions for improvement:
- The `get_game_result` method can be significantly improved by using a dictionary or a more concise approach to avoid the long chain of `if/elif/else` statements. This will make it more readable and maintainable.
- The `rock-paper-scissors.py` file is missing, which is a crucial part of the project.  The instructions clearly state to create this file with menu, input and summary functions. 
- Add error handling for the case where the user enters something other than rock, paper, or scissors in `get_user_item`.
- The code lacks score tracking as specified in the chapter instructions.  The `main` function in `rock-paper-scissors.py` should manage this.
- Implement the functions `get_user_menu_choice`, `print_results`, and `main` as specified in `Part II - rock-paper-scissors.py` section of the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement input validation in `get_user_menu_choice` to handle non-numeric or out-of-range inputs more robustly.  Currently, it only checks for specific numbers (1, 2, 3).
- Add error handling (try-except blocks) around user input to prevent crashes from unexpected input types.
- The `game.py` file is missing, preventing a complete correctness assessment. The provided code assumes the existence and correct functionality of the `Game` class and its methods.
- Improve the menu display to make it clearer and more user-friendly.  Consider using a more visually appealing format.
