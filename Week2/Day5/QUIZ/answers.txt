2. Instance - an object in a class that has specific features of a class.
3. Encapsulation - is used to restric access to methods and variables. It's done by using underscore.

5. Inheritance - an option to create a class with properties of other claa (to inherit properties from the other class).
6. Multiple inheritance - an option for a class to inherit properties from multiple classes.
