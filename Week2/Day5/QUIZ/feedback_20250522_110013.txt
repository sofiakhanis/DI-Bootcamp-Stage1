suggestions for improvement:
- The `__str__` method in the `Card` class is good for debugging and printing but consider adding a `__repr__` method for a more informative representation when inspecting the object directly.
- Add error handling or a check in the `deal` method to inform the user when the deck is empty before attempting to deal, instead of just returning a string.  A more robust approach might be to raise an exception.
- The `Deck` class initialization could be slightly improved for readability by defining `suits` and `values` as class attributes, rather than local variables within the `__init__` method.
