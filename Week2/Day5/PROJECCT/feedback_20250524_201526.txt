suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagrams.py` file is missing, which is a crucial part of the assignment.  The instructions explicitly require a separate file for user interface logic.
- Error handling for file I/O (e.g., the file not being found) is missing in `AnagramChecker.__init__`.
- The performance of `get_anagrams` could be improved by using a more efficient data structure for searching (e.g., a set or a Trie). Currently, it iterates through the entire word list.
- The program doesn't handle cases where the input file 'sowpods.txt' might contain invalid characters or lines which can cause errors.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagram_checker.py` file is missing from the provided code.  The assessment can't be completed without it.
- Error handling could be improved.  Instead of simply printing 'Invalid input...', consider providing more specific error messages (e.g., 'Input contains non-alphabetic characters' or 'More than one word entered').
- The performance could be improved by using more efficient algorithms for anagram detection (e.g., sorting characters instead of nested loops).  Currently the efficiency is not specified, thus, a conservative score is given.
- Add more comprehensive docstrings to the methods within the AnagramChecker class to explain each method's purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions it might raise.
