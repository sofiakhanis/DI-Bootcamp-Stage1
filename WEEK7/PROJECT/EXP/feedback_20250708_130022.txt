suggestions for improvement:
- The code could benefit from more descriptive variable names (e.g., instead of `query1`, use `query_count_jan_2018_orders`).
- Adding comments to explain complex SQL queries would enhance readability.
- Consider using parameterized queries instead of directly embedding values in SQL strings to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities (although not a direct concern here given the context).
- For better performance with larger datasets, explore database indexing strategies.  Currently, the queries might be slow on very large datasets.
- The file paths for CSV files are hardcoded. It's better to make them configurable through environment variables or command-line arguments for greater flexibility.
